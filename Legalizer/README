Based on abacus
How to compile and execute:
	1. Put all my files in a local directory
	2. Put the input.pl, input.scl and input.node in the same directory as input.aux
	3. $ make
	4. Lab4 executable binary will be generated
	5. ./Lab4 [input.aux]   // You can either use like 1 ./Lab4 adaptec1.aux   or  2 ./Lab4 testcase/adaptec1/adaptec1.aux 
	6. All the arguments must be specified. If you lost one of them the program will print an error message and exit.
